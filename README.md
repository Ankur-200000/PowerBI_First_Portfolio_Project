    * **Ease of Transition into Data**: A pie chart illustrating surveyed individuals' opinions on the difficulty of moving into a data role.
    * **Most Important Factors for New Job**: A pie chart breaking down the key factors people prioritize when seeking a new job in the data field.
* **Bar Graphs**:
    * **Average Salary by Profession**: A bar graph comparing average salaries across different data professions (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer).
    * **Preferred Programming Language**: A bar graph showcasing the most popular programming languages among data professionals.

## Key Filters & Dimensions

The dashboard is highly interactive, allowing users to slice and dice the data using various filters to gain granular insights:

* **Age Groups**
